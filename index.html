                    <h2><span>Entrepreneurs Only</span></h2>
		    <p>Hacker News <a href="http://ycombinator.com/announcingnews.html">launched in February 2007</a> as Startup News. It began as a social news site catered specifically
			 to programmers and entrepreneurs.</p>
		    <p>The site was created and initially moderated by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>,
			a seed accelerator that invests mostly in tech startups. Y Combinator offers funding, advice and a wealth of networking opportunities for startups who pass
			a vigorous entrance application and interview.</p>
		    <p>Hacker News was created with an experimental programming language, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>, to fill the void left by Reddit's increasing popularity. In its infancy, Reddit was funded and <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-09-26/how-y-combinator-helped-shape-redditbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">guided by Y Combinator</a>, resulting in many of its early users being connected to the company. Reddit's increasing popularity, however, meant that content shifted from a concentration of startup-related links to images, videos and political news.</p>
		    <p>Because it is so tightly coupled with the startup world, many of HN's discussions focus on <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/01/23/tuesday-january-28-digital-humanities/">digital entrepreneurship</a> in some form or another. The site itself was created to help Y Combinator get to know potential founders. In fact, being an active member on the site is a requirement to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/apply">apply to Y Combinator.</a></p>
                </div>

                    <h2><span>Identity of a Hacker</span></h2>
		    <p><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hacker">Merriam-Webster</a>, and likely many lay folk, define a hacker primarily as someone who secretly gains access to computer systems to steal information, cause damage or wreak similarly destructive havoc. However, this definition doesn't quite fit with the content of Hacker News. The site isn't designed for malevolent technical braggadocio. Rather, the original definition of a hacker in the context of computers is intended. The definition created and embodied by the AI hackers of MIT, the hardware hackers of Silicon Valley and the video game hackers of the 80s.</p>
		    <p>Steven Levy's book (which I presented on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kwv8YiV2Q75tJgBaGIGur9NOlb7sPV72wzcAjX_6-Uc/edit#slide=id.p">here</a>), <a href="http://www.stevenlevy.com/index.php/books/hackers">"Hackers - Heroes of the Computer Revolution"</a> delves deeply into these generations of hackers. But, before doing so, it defines precisely what a hacker is: one who promotes access, freedom, decentralization and learning through computers. Driven by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">Hacker Ethic</a>, a hacker pursues information and knowledge and seeks to set it free.</p>
		    <p>Many posts on Hacker News echo this sentiment. From <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7443861">security post-mortems</a> intended to educate the community, to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6695648">cheat sheets</a> for common software. Users of Hacker News aren't the nefarious, malicious beings propagated by the current definition of the word. Instead, they are merely voraciously curious technophiles.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <h2><span>#noemail</span></h2>
			<p>Although perhaps not as vehemently anti-email as <a href="http://ibiblio.org/pjones/blog/category/noemail/">Paul Jones</a>, HN's creation was partly caused by Paul Graham's dissatisfaction with the technology. In a <a href="ycombinator.com/announcingnews.html">blog post</a> announcing the creation of the site, he cites the difficulty in communication caused by email.</p>
			<p><i>"Yesterday we launched Startup News, a new component of our site with a user-ranked list of startup-related links. We created this partly for our own use: we've now funded about a hundred people, so it doesn't work well anymore to send links around by email."</i></br>&nbsp;Paul Graham</p>
			<p>Many posts on Hacker News focus on showing off new, potentially disruptive technologies. And, although email's replacement hasn't quite been settled on, I wouldn't be surprised if it was initially posted on HN. In fact, in a <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">later blog post</a>, Paul Graham explains that the disruption of email is one startup idea that Y Combinator sees often, stating:</p>
			<p><i>"Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now. Email is not a messaging protocol. It's a todo list. Or rather, my inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it. But it is a disastrously bad todo list."</i></br>&nbsp;Paul Graham</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <h2><span>Cognitive Surplus</span></h2>
			<p>Hacker News itself is a product of <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/01/16/tuesday-january-21-cognitive-surplus-and-more-with-clay-shirky/">cognitive surplus</a>. The programming language and platform that it stands upon was created by Paul Graham. Graham created <a href="http://arclanguage.org/">Arc</a>, a dialect of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> as a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html">personal project</a> in 2001. And, it would be with Arc that he would develop and release Hacker News 6 years later.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>, would likely agree with my classification of HN as a positive result of cognitive surplus. Unlike other frivolous pursuits (like LOLCats), Hacker News is a product of free time that allows its users new forms of collaboration. While the concept of HN might not be entirely novel (link aggregators are quite old), the content and discussions fostered on the site are.</p>
			<p>Two common threads in particular showcase these new forms of collaboration. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/ask">Ask HN</a>, where users ask the community for technical or personal help and <a href="http://showinghn.com/">Show HN</a>, where users show off apps/games/sites/products they've developed. Not only is the platform the result of cognitive surplus, much of the content is as well.</p>

	        <div class="section shallows">
                <div class="content">
                    <h2><span>The Shallows</span></h2>
			<p>On the opposing end of Shirky's views is <a href="http://www.nicholascarr.com/">Nicholas Carr</a>. Carr refutes the idea that time spent on the Internet can result in a net positive for users. Instead, he states that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that can diminish the capacity for concentration and deep contemplation.</p>
			<p>Rather than being a place that fosters new types of collaboration and enjoys the technologies birthed from this collaboration, <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/01/19/thursday-january-23-the-mind-in-the-net-out-of-the-shallows-with-nick-carr/">Carr's Internet</a> has negative cognitive effects on its users. Its ever-malleable nature, quickly moving pop culture and immense velocity of information have resulted in smaller attention spans and an inability to think and consider deeply. Rather than benefiting from cognitive surplus, users are inundated with cognitive overload.</p>
			<p>Hacker News has editors and moderators who seek to prevent the site from aiding Carr's argument. As part of their job, they ensure that posts on the site are mostly productive and that discussions don't heavily stray off topic. However, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hackernews.html">Paul Graham recognizes</a> that social applications can be addictive.</p>
			<p><i>"I've learned a lot from things I've read on HN. I've written several essays that began as comments there. So I wouldn't want the site to go away. But I would like to be sure it's not a net drag on productivity. What a disaster that would be, to attract thousands of smart people to a site that caused them to waste lots of time. I wish I could be 100% sure that's not a description of HN."<br/></i>&nbsp;Paul Graham</p>

			<p><a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/01/09/tuesday-january-14-imagining-the-future-internet/">We viewed</a> Tim O'Reilly's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmEz85rbO5Y">State of the Valley</a> talk given in 2013. Throughout the talk, O'Reilly predicts the direction the internet will go in the coming years and posits that the Internet will eventually grow into a "Global Brain". This Global Brain relies heavily on collaboration between multiple entities in order to grow and sustain.</p>
			<p>The Internet itself brought about a new era of collaboration. Geographic boundaries became smaller hurdles. Sites like Hacker News, those that foster discussion, place an emphasis on this collaboration. As previously mentioned, <a href="#surplus">Ask HN and Show HN</a> posts particularly, rely on this community input. Founders can post beta-versions of their startups and be critiqued by experienced professionals.</p>

His focus on non-traditional knowledge management has taken him away from email and into a realm of more experimental technologies. That he has successfully retired from email at a corporation as large as IBM is a testament to his fortitude and devotion towards an email-less Internet.</p>
			<p>Throughout his talk, and on his <a href="http://www.elsua.net">blog</a>, Suarez places on emphasis on the importance of collaboration. Communication shouldn't be sequestered into a difficult to navigate thread that provides near-continual distraction (i.e. email).</p>
			<p>Many HN users are founders or contractors working remotely. These users rely on effective and efficient collaborative communication tools (perhaps this is O'Reilly's <a href="#future">future Internet</a> coming to fruition). The site itself <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7231947">fosters</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5757047">much</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6677605">discussion</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6697416">on</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5278949">the</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6740146">topic</a>.</p>
                        <p>Hacker News has <a href="http://ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html">about 30</a> editors who collaborate to keep content reasonable and on-topic. In addition to this, the platform allows the community to self-moderate. Users can upvote posts they deem constructive and on-topic. After achieving a certain threshold of these upvotes, users gain the ability to downvote comments they deem un-constructive or inflammatory. So, not only do many users rely on collaborative tools to complete their job, they rely on them to preserve the value and integrity of the site.</p>

			<p>In her Women In Technology talk, "Are We Ready?", <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/04/01/tuesday-april-8-future-of-work/">Sophie Vandebroek</a> speaks about the transformative nature of the workplace. She posits a future era of work, where the traditional office is no more and people work wherever they like. The work experience in this era differs greatly from the current norm.</p>
			<p>It's safe to say that many users on Hacker News stay on the bleeding edge of technology as a consequence of a rapidly changing landscape. I'd also say that their work situations are similarly more advanced than most, perhaps closer to Vandebroek's vision and <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/03/02/thursday-march-6-office-of-the-future/">those we saw</a>.</p>

			<p>The site allows users to create an account with just a username and password. There is no requirement to self-identify or even provide an e-mail address.

However, frequent commenting increases the risk of recognition by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry">stylometry</a>. Obviously, those wishing to progress further into Y Combinator must identify themselves further, but not necessarily to the community.</p>
			<p>Despite the lack of requirements for self-identification, the faces behind many popular accounts are known.

                        <p>Hacker News' growth has shifted the 'feel' of the community due to increased amounts of users. Paul Graham, and fellow editors (as well as <a href="#suarez">users</a>) make a conscious effort to prevent this change, which they see as ultimately inevitable.</p>
			<p><i>As a rule, a community site that becomes popular will decline in quality. Our hypothesis is that this is not inevitable—that by making a conscious effort to resist decline, we can keep it from happening."</br></i>&nbsp;<a href="http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html">source</a>.</p>
			<p>We are <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/01/12/thursday-january-16-friends-on-and-in-the-brain/">well versed</a> in Professor Robin Dunbar's opinions on the number of meaningful relationships one can have and the constraints placed on this by technology. Perhaps with increasing membership on a site, users lose the ability to make meaningful connections with a small network. Instead, all but the most popular users drown in obscurity due to the number of total posts.</p>
			<p>Despite this seeming limitation, Hacker News has remained an active destination for technical discussion. However, it seems that Dunbar's findings remain true, to an extent. Often, certain posts attract particular users. For example, the image below shows the 20 users who most frequently submit <a href="www.medium.com">medium.com</a> links to HN. These users were also more likely to comment on others' <a href="www.medium.com">medium.com</a> posts. Y Combinator fosters a tight knit community (or perhaps comprises multiple communities) of <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/02/27/tuesday-march-4-digital-natives-or-naives/">digital natives</a>. This is particularly as a result of its close affiliation with the startup world. Most all in the community would perform very well in Eszter Hargittai's studies.

However, I did find a report whose results seem to be a direct result of the <a href="#identity">ambiguous definition</a> of hacker. <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/05/anonymity-privacy-and-security-online/">The study</a> found that more Americans are afraid of their activity being monitored by hackers and advertisers than the government.</p>

			<p>I submitted an Ask HN post (that has since been deleted by the editors) asking the community if they had ever met and had a subsequent romantic relationship with anyone from the site. Perhaps unsurprisingly, but to my own disdain, the post received no traction at all. The users of the site don't seem particularly focused on online romantic relationships, despite the seeming popularity of the practice that we saw in our <a hre="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/02/06/thursday-february-13-online-dating/">class discussion</a>.</p>
			<p>Y Combinator, however, has funded a startup focused on online dating called <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/the-dating-ring-sf">The Dating Ring</a>.</p>

                        <p>A public Hacker News dataset (current to November 7, 2010) is available <a href="http://api.ihackernews.com">here</a>. The site seems to be currently defunct and no longer tracks and catalogs submissions. The content of Hacker News itself is unlikely large enough to be considered <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/02/23/thursday-february-27-big-data-at-ibm/">Big Data</a>.</p>
			<p>In our discussion on Big Data, the class reached a general consensus that data was considered "big" once it became too large to handle with traditional database tools. The search engine on Hacker News <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=">currently indexes</a> 1,321,829 stories and 5,747,868 comments. Considering that the contents of these submissions are almost entirely textual, Y Combinator is unlikely to be strapped for storage space.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that it isn't Big Data, the contents of Hacker News is often statistically analyzed. These analyses are available <a href="http://minimaxir.com/2014/02/hacking-hacker-news">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.rjmetrics.com/2014/01/23/hacker-news-data-analysis-2014-edition/">here</a>.

			<p>The <a href="#bigdata">aforementioned site</a> that creates an archive of Hacker News and its content is an example of digital humanities at work. The creator of the site seeks to preserve the knowledge and information on Hacker News by making it freely available and decoupling it from the actual sight.</p>
			<p>When Dr. Michael Newton <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/03/23/thursday-march-27-digital-humanities-at-unc/">talked</a> to our class, he spoke of the wide range of digital humanities projects that he was involved with. At the center of his talk was his focus on The Academy and the detrimental effects it can have on digital humanitarians and their projects. HN users themselves have <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=hacking+the+academy#!/story/forever/prefix/0/hacking%20academy">spoken</a> on this very topic.</p>

                    <h2><span>Memes & Remix</span></h2>
			<p>Due to the editors' devotion to productive and intellectually engaging content, image macros and other memetic devices often don't succeed as posts on Hacker News. Because submissions including image macros and other memes are often off-topic to the original discussion, editors are quick to flag and remove them.</p>
                        <p>However, the community is still subject to memetic tendencies, perhaps much to the delight of <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/03/24/tuesday-april-1-memes-and-remix/">Richard Dawkins</a>. <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meme">His definition</a> of a meme states that it is an idea, behavior, style, or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture. By this definition, Hacker News is home to many memes.</p>
                        <p>For example, the game <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> was released recently to much applause on Hacker News. The community quickly began recreating and remixing the game into totally new, sometimes barely recognizable products and posting these back onto HN.</p>

                    <h2><span>Fandom</span></h2>
			<p>Due to its proximity with Y Combinator, Hacker News generally attracts tech-savvy digital natives. Its users generally have highly specialized knowledge and interests in particular fields and are ardent fans of certain technologies. Although not associated as closely with Japan-based cultural phenomena, the sites users fit Mimi Ito's <a href="http://inls697002spring14.web.unc.edu/2014/03/29/thursday-april-3-fandom-unbound-otaku-culture-in-a-connected-world/">definition</a> of otaku quite well.</p>
			<p>Since many users are founders of Y Combinator funded companies, it should be no surprise that the site itself possesses a unique culture of perhaps overly pedantic, but intelligent engineers. The culture that the users have created has resulted in particular programming languages enjoying a sort of fandom on the site. The first image below shows the frequency of submissions to the site based on programming language. Javascript is, by far, the most popularly submitted language on the site. The second image below, however, shows a slightly different story. Despite being low on the list of frequently posted languages, Lisp holds first place for average submission score. Each of these languages enjoys a particular fandom on the site; it seems that the site as a whole, however, favors lisp.</p>
